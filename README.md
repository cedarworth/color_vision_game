    <p> A color vision trivial game to test individual's ability to recognize color when three primary colors of varying texture are mixed. 
    Although, the game is not a true clinical procedural test to be able to tell if one is medically color blind. However, the game helps  one to be able to appreciate their level of recognition of colors and if any deficiency is noticed, you should consult your Optometrist immediately. 
    The color vision game is fun to play. The frontend architecture is achieved with HTML and CSS. Bootstrap framework was also used to make it more responsive with different devices: screen width. The backend logic was achieved with JavaScript. This enables the user to be able to pick any color block deemed as the correct resultant color of mixing the three primary colors (rgb).
